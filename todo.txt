Consider adding autocomplete to editor.
    - might need a way to turn that off.

Add in the collapse domain arrows again.
    - save the state

Bug with scripts not being executed first or last in the document.
    for body scripts: wait for the window 'load' event to inject.

    cant really use a static content script.
    Might have to do something like this:
        chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {code: 'eval(decodeURIComponent("' + encodeURIComponent($0.value) + '"));'});
        or consider using this: https://github.com/joliss/js-string-escape

Fix delete button looking like crap on mac.

Make example for how to override a buncha stuff except for some things.
    - do we need a tips popup?

Close editors when we get a sync update.

Maybe make a request url tester that shows what rule it will hit

Bug where suggestions are wrong after navigation
    - This is kind of a hard one. Need to implement background page -> devtools messaging.
    - https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools#content-script-to-devtools
    - Should probably refactor all of messaging.
    - // on devtools page:
      var backgroundPagePort = chrome.runtime.connect({name: "asd"});
      backgroundPagePort.onMessage.addListener(function(data, port) {
            var func = backgroundPageFuncs[data.action];
            if (func) {
                func(data, port);
            }
      });
      // on background page:
      chrome.runtime.onConnect.addListener(function(port) {
        // store port with some id. Might need to have devtools page send one.
      });
      somePort.postMessage({asd: "Qwe"});

Add a way to know the rule type after added?
Add ability to drag tab url groups?
Make help section suck less. No one understands how *s work.
